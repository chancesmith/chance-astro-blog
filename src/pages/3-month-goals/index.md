Almost 4 years now we've done quartley checkups with our team. Every 3 months, we'll meet with one team member and see how their doing and ask how we can help them.

## Goal Setting for the Team

Yet, one area we've had the most trouble is helping them set goals for themselves. We've pushed them to think 5 years out about where they want to be. Like Google does, the 3 Month Goal is aimed to be worked on during ~20% of their at-work time. If the goal can be centered around how it helps the them, the team, AND the company, it's a win-win-win. Think IKIGAI.

## New Goal Setting Idea

Here is what we came up with today. We'll see how it goes.

**3 Month Goal**: What if you set a goal of X number of sandboxes created over the next x weeks (until next checkup) covering a mix of X, Y, Z areas in which you want to practice (ie. backend, full-stack, TDD, a11y, react-native)?

**Example**: So I can get reps in areas that help me and SH...by April 10th, I'll have completed 4 tiny sandboxes related to upcoming features we need in SH projects. I'll complete one every 2-3 weeks and share with the team during Beer30 or loom.

We hope this approach will make it easier to set trackable goals and less intimidating.
